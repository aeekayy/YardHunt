# YardHunt
The hunt for a house in Orange County. This is a two part personal project.
1. The first goal is to use a neural network to get the expected price of a house that we are looking to buy. We're looking to buy property in Orange County. How does the features of the house and asking price compare to the actual selling price of a property
2. Hopefully use some sort of machine learning for renting property too
